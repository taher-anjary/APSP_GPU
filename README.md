# APSP_GPU

GPU implementation of Floyd-Warshall and R-Kleene algorithms to solve the All-Pairs-Shortest-Paths(APSP) problem on Graphs. 

Code includes random graph generators and benchmarking/plotting scripts.

The heart of GPU utilization for solving APSP problems is the 'min-plus' opertaion, best described by the gif below:
